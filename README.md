## E-commerce using API

### Description :
This project leverages the power of React's useReducer hook to efficiently manage product filters, button toggles, and cart items. The ComfySloth API serves as the reliable source for fetching product-related data. Additionally, Auth0 is seamlessly integrated to provide robust user authentication capabilities. Formspree handles the smooth transmission of form data. The implementation involves JavaScript event listeners and functions, such as sort, to effectively handle filters and toggle view buttons. Users are presented with two engaging viewing options: grid view and list view. The intuitive user interface allows for seamless filtering of products based on price range, colors, brand names, and shipping fees. Furthermore, a strong emphasis has been placed on ensuring the responsiveness and overall user-friendliness of the interface.
