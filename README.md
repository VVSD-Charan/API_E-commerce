## E-commerce using API
### Deployed Link : https://decor-mart.netlify.app/

### Description :
Decor Mart is a website where you can shop for home decor items. It uses a special tool called React's useReducer to help you find products easily by using filters and buttons. It gets information about the products from a reliable source called the ComfySloth API. You can also create an account and log in because it has a strong security feature called Auth0.

When you want to ask questions or share your thoughts, there's a way to do that using Formspree. The website is made with a type of computer code called JavaScript, which helps it do things like sorting products. You can see the products in two different ways: as a grid or as a list.

Decor Mart is designed to be easy to use, so you can quickly find products based on price, colors, brands, and shipping costs. Plus, it works well on different devices like phones and computers, making it user-friendly.
